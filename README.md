## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 I'm a **Mobile App Developer** with a BSc in Agriculture from Landmark University, but my heart beats for tech!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Healio** – a smart, health-centered mobile app designed to revolutionize how people manage health, book appointments, track prescriptions, and integrate IoT health devices. *(More to come!)* 💊📱
- 🧠 I’m currently deep-diving into **Flutter**, **Firebase**, **UI/UX best practices**, and advanced **FlutterFlow** development.
- 💬 Ask me about mobile app development, FlutterFlow best practices, or turning ideas into full-fledged apps.
- 🌱 Fun fact: I started coding out of curiosity and stayed because I love solving real-world problems with elegant code! 🚀
